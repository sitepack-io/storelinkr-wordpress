== Description ==

Start selling products without your own stock now. Your own dropshipping online store with real quality products and partners. No drop shipment from China via the StoreLinkr platform.

## THE #1 DATA LINK FOR YOUR WEBSHOP

Our data connection helps you to quickly and easily connect one or more wholesalers to your WooCommerce online store. We are unique in our kind, because we have created an intermediate step between the wholesaler and your webshop.

This intermediate step allows us to read all catalog data from the wholesaler directly to our platform. On the StoreLinkr platform you can exclude, edit and overwrite data.

Once the data is correct, it will only be transferred to your WordPress website. We update your online store at least 4 times a day and stock is even a maximum of 15 minutes old!

### STAY IN CONTROL OF YOUR CATALOGUE

With our unique import filters it is possible to put together your range during import. Select only the product groups you would like to sell.

It is also possible to exclude products from export to your webshop based on:
* **Minimum quantity in stock**, only display products in your webshop that you can sell directly
* **Minimum number of images**, only show products if they have an image
* **Minimum price or maximum price**, determine your own range by activating an active price filter
* And much more..
